========================================
Working with Objects and Arrays as State
========================================

One important note off the bat, if we have a 
setState function that sets a state var to 10,
then try re-setting it to 10 again, react won't 
force a re-render

React sees that the state var is already 10, so 
there's no need to re-render

But the main thing to note here is that in React, 
we always make a copy of a state object and array 
before mutating it, we usually use ...spread operator 
to make a copy, then mutate the copy for the state 

Arrays have the same considerations, if we need 
to change the state, we need a new copy, there are 
array methods that help us do this
