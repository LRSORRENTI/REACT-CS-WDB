Generating Unique ID's With UUID
================================

In order to remove any value from a given array,
each value will need a unique identifier, 
there's a package available called uuid that 
makes creating unique id's easy, UUID 

So we want each value to be an object with: 

{
    id: 'unique UUID here', 
    emoji: ':D'
}
