Accessing Event Object
======================

Often we'll need to access the event object itself,
for keypress or form events for example: 

export default function Form(){
    return(
        <form>
        <button>
            Submit
        </button>
        </form>
    )
}

Notice when the button is clicked the page refreshes

This is not what we want in React, we have a SPA 
and page refreshes aren't what we want in SPA's 

We control what the end user sees by using JS, 
that way the page never needs a refresh

So to prevent that default behavior, we utilize 
the event object, and call the prevent default 
behavior method: 

function handleFormSubmit(event){
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log('Submitted the form')
}

Now on submit press, no page refresh, default 
behavior is gone

Often times we may not need to event object,
but understanding how to access the event methods 
is crucial in React
