=====================
Basic React Structure
=====================

There are some basic React structure conventions
that most React apps follow 

One if to have an App.js component, this is typically 
the highest level component, then inside of the 
index.js, we render that <App /> inside of the 
root div from index.html, typically you'll never change 
the structure of the index.js:

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
const root = createRoot(rootElement);

root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);


But inside of App.js, that's where we'll add 
components to render:

import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
    <Navbar/>
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox!</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
        <input 
        type="text" placeholder="enter name"></input>
        <Footer/>
    </div>
  );
}

So maybe we render a navbar and footer component in 
the above app, then maybe those navbar / footer 
are rendering their own components, an so on 

That's the concept here, components nested in components
all the way down
