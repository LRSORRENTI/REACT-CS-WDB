Form Validation
===============

Right now we can add items while only 
imputting quantity field, there are libraries 
that can help with form validation but we'll 
implement it from scratch here 

One approach would be to add state for every 
input field we have, where we set useState to 
false initially then validate: 

const [productIsValid, setProductIsValid] = useState(false);

const [quantityIsValid, setQuantityIsValid] = useState(false);

This approach is fine if we only have two fields 
but if our form has 10 or more field inputs it can 
be much better to store those state variables 
in an object
