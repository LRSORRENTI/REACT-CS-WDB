Intro to React Forms
====================

The reason React forms is taught later on is 
because understanding state is required before 
implementing forms in React 

HTML form elements work differently in React since 
they naturally keep some internal state, not React 
state but it maintains a bit of data on it's own

In React, we'll usually have a specific JS function 
that handles form submission, as well as has access 
to the data the user enters 

This technique is Controlled Components 

We'll create a React bit of State, then make that 
the source of truth, where React controls what's 
shown, and what happens as the user types 

The technique involves tracking every key input 
as the user types, instead of waiting until the end 
and grabbing all the data, we grab each character as 
the user is typing, then the React state we have will 
bind to that user input
