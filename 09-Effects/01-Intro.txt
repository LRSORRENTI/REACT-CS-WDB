Introducing React useEffect Hook
================================

Another one of the most used hooks in React 
is useEffect 

But first a recap of rendering and state: 

- When we call a state setter function [myState, changeState] 
  when changeState is called inside of a component,
  the component re-renders and we get the new state 
  value for myState 

But if we want to add some functionality immediately 
after a first render or re-render we can !

In react these functionality changes immediately after 
the first render or re-render are called effects, or 
side effects

We can use this useEffect hook to change parts of the 
DOM that aren't covered by React

We can use it for ASYNC operations like fetching 
data from an api when the component is mounted 

Change things right before a component un-mounts
