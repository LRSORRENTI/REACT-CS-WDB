useEffect Dependencies
======================

The next part of useEffect that's crucial to cover is 
that we can pass a second argument, we saw in the first 
lecture:

useEffect(myCallbackFn);

Where myCallbackFn runs after every render and 
re-render 

But we can also provide a second argument: 

useEffect(myCallbackFn, [productId, userId]);

The above runs myCallbackFn effect only when 
productId or userId changes 

productId and userId are known as Dependencies in 
this context, basically just two pieces of state 
that are watched for changes 

This also means myCallbackFn will only be called 
when either of those two pieces of state change, 
if something else were to change myCallbackFn sits 
idle
