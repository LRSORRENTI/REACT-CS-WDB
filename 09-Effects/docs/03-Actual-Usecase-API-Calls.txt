=====================================================
Real world use case of useEffect - Fetching Data from 
an API
=====================================================

A real world use case that you'll useEffect used a lot 
with is fetching data, but we only want to do this once
not on every single render, as fetching data from an 
api can take time, and if we make those api calls 
every time state changes or the component re-renders 
that's going to take a lot of time 

When a component renders, fetch data from an api

- Data fetching is asynchronous, takes time to 
  complete 
- Show loading message to user while fetching 

To fetch correctly: 

- Have a useEffect that only runs once

- Inside that effect, when api call is done, 
  set state and re-render
