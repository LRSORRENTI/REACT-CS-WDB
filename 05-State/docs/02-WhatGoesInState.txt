=======================
What goes inside State?
=======================

- Data fetched from an API

- Form information 

- A variable that "decides" is something 
  should be hidden or visible 

- Will a value ever change? If true it should 
  go inside of State 

  A good example is a like button for a comment 
  or post on a web app, that value can change but 
  if you refresh the page, it remains true or false 
  depending if you pressed the like button
