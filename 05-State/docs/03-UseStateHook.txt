What is the useState Hook?
==========================

useState is on example of a React Hook, and hooks 
are functions React provides to provide 
functionality to components, useState is one of 
the more widely used hook, and they all begin 
with the word 'use', so if you ever see a function
and it begins with useSomething, it's likely a 
React Hook

One way to create state is with the 
useState hook, it looks something like: 

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

The above returns an array containing two 
elements: 

- The state itself (count)

- And the function to update the state (setCount)

useState must be called from inside a component
