React State
===========

In this section we'll go over one of the most 
critically important concepts of React, which is 
State 

So far we learned components are re-usable 
building blocks that combine logic and presentation,
they can be big or small components 

We also learned about properties, or props, values 
we can pass into those components

Now we'll practice and learn State, which is 
data specific to an instance of a component, 
key takeaway is STATE CAN CHANGE 

To demonstrate State in a basic way we'll create a counter 
component, and counter will return a paragraph 
that will track how many times a button has been 
clicked
