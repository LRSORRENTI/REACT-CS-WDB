=============
Die Component
=============

This component is only here for the die, 
it's stateless, it's just a div that renders 
a value, it gets one value as a prop, then passes 
that prop into the jsx, it's purely presentational: 

export default function Die( {val} ) {
    return(
        <div className="die">
            {val}
        </div>
    );
};
