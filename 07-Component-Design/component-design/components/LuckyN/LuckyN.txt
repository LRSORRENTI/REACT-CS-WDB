LuckyN Game
===========

This LuckyN component will be where we 
have our state tracked to determine a winner, 
notice so far we've added zero state to Die or 
Dice components

That's because state cannot travel upwards, 
now that we're constructing our parent component
we can start to strategize how we'll implement 
state 

As an example, if maybe we were tracking multiple 
LuckyN games at the same time for whatever reason, we 
wouldn't include state inside here at all, but 
since we're only going to implement a single game 
this is where we have our state, parent level state 
management

This component will have a prop called numDice,
and we'll have a prop called goal 

But we also need to implement state now, if we have 
a game, we need to keep track of what values the 
dice add up to, if 7 is the goal or whatever the goal 
is we need to have a check

So we'll need to add: 

- Props:  numDice and goal

- State:  dice: [n, ...]

- Events: roll()

And in App.jsx, we only render this LuckyN 
component, nothing else, since we have components 
rendering components, we useState and manage state 
in this parent level component
