=========================
Intro to component design
=========================

This section will focus on taking everything
we've learned so far about props, events, state 
and combine them all to build a more real-world 
esque react structure

Goals for the section: 

- Understand strategies for 'component decomposition'

- Practice designing the structure of a React app
  the way it's done in a real job or project

- Learn how to pass functions between components 

We'll practice these concepts by building a game, 
a game where we'll have two dice, if after the 
dice roll each add up to sevem, we roll a five 
and a two, we win, or three and four..

But we'll also struture the app so that we can 
play lucky (n), lucky 10, lucky 20 where we have more than 
two dice, we'll structure this app so that it can be 
easily extended and customizable

Requirements: 

- Play a dice game with numDice or number of dice 
  and a selection for the add up to goal, 7, 10, 20...

- Display a winning banner if the user wins the game 

- Implement a roll again button that re-rolls all the 
  dice
